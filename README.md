# remove_duplicate_elements_from_java_array
Problem Statement:
==================
1.	Given the following class, write 3 methods that can be used to print out an array that has no duplicates.
2.	You should define a method signature that you feel is appropriate to the problem.
3.	We would prefer to see three implementations (one that should take into consideration #4 below) and an explanation of what use-cases are suitable to each implementation 
4.	What if we need to retain the original order?
5.	What are the positives and negatives of your solution?
a.	Can you implement it another way so as to avoid the negatives?
6.	Your solution should be “production ready.”
